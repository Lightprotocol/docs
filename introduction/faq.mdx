  <Accordion title="Why should I care?">
    Because rent is expensive. On Solana, each token account costs ~0.002 SOL in rent. zkCompressed accounts avoid this entirely. If your app involves lots of users, tokens, or accounts—this matters.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much cheaper is it?">
    Typical savings: **1,000x–5,000x cheaper** per account.

    Creating 100 token accounts the normal way costs ~0.2 SOL. With zkCompression, it's ~0.00004 SOL.

  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Who is this for?">
  zkCompression is perfect for: - **Airdrop Tools**: Apps that need to create
  thousands of token accounts for mass distributions - **Consumer Apps**:
  Applications doing reward distribution or gamified tokens - **DePIN
  Protocols**: Protocols managing long-tail devices/users at scale -
  **Infrastructure Providers**: Providers who want to offer rent-free state to
  users - **Any Scalable App**: Any application needing scalable, low-cost
  account creation
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What can I compress?">
  - **Token Accounts**: SPL-compatible token accounts via the compressed-token
  package - **Custom Account Types**: Any custom account type with deterministic
  structure - **App-Specific State**: Structured app state like identity,
  reputation, game data
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="What can't I compress?">
  - **Arbitrary Program State**: Dynamic or pointer-based data structures that
  change unpredictably - **Concurrent Mutable Data**: Data that needs to be
  mutable by multiple parties concurrently without coordination - **Complex
  Data**: Data too large or complex to prove efficiently (e.g. full game world
  state)
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Do I need to write my own ZK circuits?">
  **No.** zkCompression provides battle-tested circuits and client SDKs. You
  interact with simple APIs like `mintCompressed()` or
  `createCompressedAccount()`.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Can I still use regular Solana instructions?">
  **Yes.** Compressed accounts are compatible with normal Solana instructions.
  You can mix compressed and uncompressed accounts in the same transaction.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Is this a separate chain or L2?">
  **No.** Everything runs on Solana L1. zkCompression simply lets you treat
  Solana as a state root layer while keeping the actual data off-chain.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Where is the data stored?">
  Compressed data is stored off-chain in a distributed network of RPC providers,
  with state commitments anchored on Solana L1. This ensures data availability
  while dramatically reducing costs.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this Mainnet-ready?">
    **Yes.** zkCompression is live on Solana Mainnet and battle-tested. SDKs and proof systems are stable, with ongoing optimizations.
