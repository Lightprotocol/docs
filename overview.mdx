ZK Compression is a new primitive on Solana that drastically reduces your on-chain costs by up to 5000x for token accounts and 160x for PDAs, while maintaining full Solana security, performance, and composability.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What problem does it solve?">
    zkCompression solves the expensive rent problem on Solana. Each token account costs ~0.002 SOL in rent, which becomes prohibitively expensive at scale. zkCompression eliminates this cost entirely by storing account data off-chain while maintaining security through state commitments on Solana L1.

<Accordion title="Who is this for?">
  zkCompression is perfect for: - **Airdrop Tools**: Apps that need to create
  thousands of token accounts for mass distributions - **Consumer Apps**:
  Applications doing reward distribution or gamified tokens - **DePIN
  Protocols**: Protocols managing long-tail devices/users at scale -
  **Infrastructure Providers**: Providers who want to offer rent-free state to
  users - **Any Scalable App**: Any application needing scalable, low-cost
  account creation
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Is this an L2?">
  **No.** Everything runs on Solana L1. zkCompression simply lets you treat
  Solana as a state root layer while keeping the actual data off-chain.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where is the data stored?">
    Compressed data is stored off-chain in a distributed network of RPC providers, with state commitments anchored on Solana L1. This ensures data availability while dramatically reducing costs.
