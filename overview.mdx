ZK Compression is Solana's state compression primitive that uses zero-knowledge proofs to compress account data into Merkle trees, reducing on-chain storage costs by up to 5,000x while maintaining security, composability, and Solana's performance.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What problem does it solve?">
    zkCompression solves the expensive rent problem on Solana. Each token account costs ~0.002 SOL in rent, which becomes prohibitively expensive at scale. zkCompression eliminates this cost entirely by storing account data off-chain while maintaining security through state commitments on Solana L1.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much money does it save me?">
    Typical savings: **1,000xâ€“5,000x cheaper** per account.

    Creating 100 token accounts the normal way costs ~0.2 SOL. With zkCompression, it's ~0.00004 SOL.

  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Who is this for?">
  zkCompression is perfect for: - **Airdrop Tools**: Apps that need to create
  thousands of token accounts for mass distributions - **Consumer Apps**:
  Applications doing reward distribution or gamified tokens - **DePIN
  Protocols**: Protocols managing long-tail devices/users at scale -
  **Infrastructure Providers**: Providers who want to offer rent-free state to
  users - **Any Scalable App**: Any application needing scalable, low-cost
  account creation
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Is this an L2?">
  **No.** Everything runs on Solana L1. zkCompression simply lets you treat
  Solana as a state root layer while keeping the actual data off-chain.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where is the data stored?">
    Compressed data is stored off-chain in a distributed network of RPC providers, with state commitments anchored on Solana L1. This ensures data availability while dramatically reducing costs.
