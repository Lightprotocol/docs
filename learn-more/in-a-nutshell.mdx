1. **State is stored directly as call data on Solana’s ledger, greatly reducing rent costs.**

2. **Transactions explicitly declare which state they read or modify within their payloads.**

3. **Solana programs invoke the Light Protocol System Program to perform state updates and compression.**

4. **The protocol rigorously validates state integrity, including sum checks, ownership verification, and consistency of existing data.**

5. **Classic accounts are transitioned to compressed accounts, maintaining a familiar account structure and layout.**

6. **Each instruction's resulting state changes are transparently logged on Solana’s ledger.**

7. **Photon RPC Nodes index these state logs, providing clients efficient access through the ZK Compression RPC API.**

8. **Forester Nodes (Keeper Nodes) continuously manage and optimize the system by emptying queues and rolling over state trees.**
