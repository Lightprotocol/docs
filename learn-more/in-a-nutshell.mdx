**In a Nutshell**

**System Overview:**

- State stored as calldata on Solana's ledger, minimizing rent costs.
- Transactions explicitly declare accessed state within their payloads.

**State Validation:**

- Solana programs call Light Protocol to manage compressed state.
- Protocol ensures validity, ownership, and correct sums.
- Compressed accounts follow a defined schema, similar to classic accounts.

**State Updates:**

- Updated states logged directly to the Solana ledger after each instruction.

**Photon RPC Nodes:**

- Index ledger logs, providing compressed state via the ZK Compression RPC API.

**Forester (Keeper) Nodes:**

- Regularly process queues and manage state tree rollovers through the Account Compression Program.
