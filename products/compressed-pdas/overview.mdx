# Compressed PDAs Overview

Welcome to the Compressed PDAs section. This page provides an overview of compressed Program Derived Addresses in ZK Compression.

## What are Compressed PDAs?

Compressed Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) are compressed versions of Solana's Program Derived Addresses that maintain the same functionality while providing enhanced efficiency and cost benefits.

## Key Features

- **Storage Optimization**: Significantly reduced on-chain storage footprint
- **Cost Reduction**: Lower costs for PDA creation and management
- **Deterministic**: Maintain the deterministic nature of traditional PDAs
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Leverage ZK proofs for verification

## Use Cases

- Account management systems
- State management for dApps
- Cross-program invocations
- Complex program architectures

## Getting Started

Explore our SDK documentation to learn how to implement compressed PDAs in your Solana programs.
