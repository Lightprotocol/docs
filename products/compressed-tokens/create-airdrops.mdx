# Create Airdrops with Compressed Tokens

Learn how to create efficient and cost-effective airdrops using compressed tokens in ZK Compression.

## Overview

Compressed tokens enable you to create airdrops that are significantly more cost-effective than traditional Solana token airdrops, while maintaining the same functionality and user experience.

## Benefits of Compressed Token Airdrops

- **Cost Reduction**: Up to 99% reduction in airdrop costs compared to traditional tokens
- **Scalability**: Distribute to thousands of recipients without hitting network limits
- **Instant Distribution**: Batch multiple recipients in single transactions
- **Gas Efficiency**: Minimal on-chain footprint per recipient

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites

- ZK Compression SDK installed
- Solana wallet with sufficient funds
- List of recipient addresses

### Basic Airdrop Setup

```typescript
import { createAirdrop } from "@lightprotocol/zk-compression";

// Configure your airdrop parameters
const airdropConfig = {
  tokenMint: "your-compressed-token-mint",
  recipients: recipientAddresses,
  amountPerRecipient: 1000000, // 1 token (adjust for decimals)
  merkleTree: "your-merkle-tree-address",
};
```

### Advanced Features

- **Batch Processing**: Process large recipient lists efficiently
- **Conditional Airdrops**: Set conditions for token claiming
- **Merkle Proofs**: Verify recipient eligibility off-chain
