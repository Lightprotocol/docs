# Security

## Our Security Approach

ZK Compression is built with security as a fundamental principle. Our multi-layered security approach ensures the highest level of protection for your compressed data.

## Security Features

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

All compressed data is secured using cryptographic proofs that maintain the integrity of your information without revealing sensitive details. This ensures privacy while maintaining verifiability.

### State Commitment Anchoring

All state commitments are anchored directly on Solana L1, ensuring the same security guarantees as native Solana accounts. This provides the full security of the Solana blockchain.

### Cryptographic Integrity

- **Merkle Tree Validation**: All state changes are validated through cryptographic merkle trees
- **Proof Verification**: Every transaction includes validity proofs that are verified on-chain
- **Hash-based Security**: Account states are secured using cryptographic hashing

## Security Practices

### Regular Security Audits

We conduct regular security audits with leading blockchain security firms to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

### Open Source Transparency

Our codebase is open source and available for community review and contribution. This ensures transparency and allows for community-driven security improvements.

### Responsible Disclosure

We maintain a responsible disclosure program for security researchers to report vulnerabilities safely and receive recognition for their contributions.

## Security Compliance

- **Industry Standards**: We follow industry best practices for blockchain security
- **Regular Assessments**: Ongoing security assessments and penetration testing
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of security metrics and anomalies

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

- **Security Email**: security@lightprotocol.com
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond to security reports within 24 hours
- **Disclosure Timeline**: We follow a coordinated disclosure process
